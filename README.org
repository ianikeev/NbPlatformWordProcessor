* Custom Launcher to Use With the Bundled JRE

Compile it with ~cl launcher.c /link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS kernel32.lib user32.lib~

This launcher is specifically made for Windows and is compiled with Microsoft's
Visual C++ compiler. It checks if it's run from the console. If it is so, it
attaches itself to it and redirects =stdin=, =stdout=, and =stderr=, if not, it runs
as a proper GUI program.

* Single Source of Truth for the Version Number

The Powershell script obtains the date and time based version number from the
system and then passes it to Ant during the build stage and to the installer
generator.
